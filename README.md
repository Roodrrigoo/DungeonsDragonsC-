# C++ Project: “Dungeons and Dragons” Game with Dynamic Monsters

![Dungeon and Dragons](https://github.com/Roodrrigoo/DungeonsDragonsC-/blob/main/imgs/Dungeon%20Dragons.png?raw=true)

This project is developed in C++ and is based on the creation of a game inspired by the popular role-playing game “Dungeons and Dragons.” The main focus of the project is the dynamics of creatures and monsters within an interactive and adaptive environment, where players must face various dynamically generated creatures.

## General Description

The game implements an abstract data type (ADT) to represent a monster, allowing the creation of multiple types of creatures with unique characteristics. Monsters have attributes such as strength, health, and special abilities, which vary depending on the type of creature.

## Main Features
- **Dynamic monsters**: Each monster is generated with random characteristics within certain predefined parameters, ensuring that each encounter with a creature is unique.
- **Abstract data type**: We use an ADT to encapsulate the properties and behaviors of the monsters, guaranteeing a clear interface to interact with them.
- **Linked lists**: Linked lists are used to manage the collection of monsters efficiently, allowing the addition or removal of creatures during the execution of the game without losing performance.
- **Templates**: We have used templates to ensure that the code is flexible and can handle multiple data types in the game structure, allowing code reuse with different types of creatures or scenarios.
- **Efficient data structure**: The data structure used allows for optimal monster creation, handling, and removal, ensuring adequate performance even with large volumes of creatures in the game.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: C++
- **Data structures**: Linked lists, templates, and ADTs.
- **Paradigm**: Object-oriented programming (OOP), with a focus on abstraction and code reuse.

## Project Objectives
1. Create a dynamic monster system that allows players to face different creatures in each game.
2. Optimize creature handling using linked lists to improve performance in memory management and data access.
3. Implement an abstract data type that encapsulates the characteristics of a monster, providing a clear and flexible structure for future expansions of the game.

## Future Improvements
- **New monster types**: Include more creatures with unique behaviors and abilities.
- **Expansion of the game environment**: Add more scenarios and quests for players.
- **Graphical interface**: Implement a graphical interface to improve the user experience.
